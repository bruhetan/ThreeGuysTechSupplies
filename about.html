            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Three Guys: Tech Supplies is a small business founded by three technology enthusiasts who were frustrated
                with the lack of affordable and high-quality computer parts available to consumers. Determined to
                provide a better shopping experience, they decided to create their own store. </p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
