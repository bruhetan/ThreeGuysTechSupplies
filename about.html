            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Three Guys: Tech Supplies is a small business run by three guys with a love for technology. TGTS was
                created due to a lack of good places to buy computer parts with good deals, so we decided to step up and
                make our own.</p>
            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
            <p>When we started working on this project, we set out to make your one stop place to shop for every part of
                your future computer. Our goal is to make it simple and easy for you to pick out and buy the best parts
                that you're looking for.</p>
            <p>Along with providing the best place to find computer parts, we wanted to create a place where
                inexperienced people who are looking out to buy a computer could find what they wanted with ease. That's
                why we have our signature pre-built desktop computers.</p>
            <h3>Our Name</h3>
            <p>You may be wondering, "Where does the name Three Guys: Tech Supplies come from?", and to answer that
                question, it's simple. We were inspired by Five Guys: Burgers and Fries! We wanted a name that sounded
                good and rhymed, and what better place to get inspiration from than Five Guys.</p>
