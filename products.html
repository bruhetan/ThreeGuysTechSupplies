                    Vengeance LPX memory is designed for high-performance overclocking. The heatspreader is made of pure aluminum for faster heat dissipation, 
                    and the eight-layer PCB helps manage heat and provides superior overclocking headroom. Each IC is individually screened for performance 
                    potential. The DDR4 form factor is optimized for the latest Intel X99 and 100 Series motherboards and offers higher frequencies, 
                    greater bandwidth, and lower power consumption than DDR3 modules. Vengeance LPX DDR4 modules are compatibility-tested across X99 and 
                    100 Series motherboards for reliably fast performance. There's XMP 2.0 support for trouble-free automatic overclocking. And, they're 
                    available in multiple colors to match your motherboard, your components, or just your style.

                    The RM650x is a high performance PSU featuring great build quality and a very silent operation. It is 
                    offered at a fair price and the ten-year warranty is the cherry on top. Its major problem seems to be the 
                    harsh competition from EVGA's similar priced offerings, especially the 650 P2 model.
